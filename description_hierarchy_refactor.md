# Refactoring Suggestions

## Split by Domain Concept:
Move node-related functions to XIAM.Hierarchy.NodeManager
Move access-related functions to XIAM.Hierarchy.AccessManager
Create a dedicated XIAM.Hierarchy.PathCalculator module

## Extract LiveView Components:
Break down hierarchy_live.ex into smaller components
Create dedicated components for node tree, node form, access management

## Standardize API Layer:
Refactor API controller into smaller, more focused controllers
Create shared validation modules for both LiveView and API

## Improve Caching Strategy:
Consolidate cache invalidation into a single place
Consider a more declarative caching approach

## Add Context Boundaries:
Clear separation between UI, business logic, and data access
Better organized interfaces between layers

This approach would make the code more maintainable, easier to test, and lower the cognitive load when working with these modules. It would also align with Elixir's emphasis on small, focused modules with clear responsibilities.
