I want to extend the Entity Access feature with a hierarchy of nodes. That will make it able to handle a large number of elements (1.000.000+ elements) in a hierarchy. This gives the user the ability to check for any nodes in the hierarchy if the user has access to it.

I have this Elixir, Phoenix app powered by Postgres. There I want to be able to define a large (1.000.000+ elements) hierarchy. In this case it will be countries, companies, installations, zones and elements, but should work in general. Users are associated with one or more nodes in this hierarchy that they can access. I need an endpoint in the api where the api user can give me any element for which the api answers if the user has access. I've heard that using ltree tables in Postgres is a good approach. For the best approach, make a plan that I can refer to in Windsurf when implementing this feature. I don't need example code but a good description of the way to implement this.


⸻

Below is a battle-tested roadmap you can copy into Windsurf as an implementation checklist.
I assume that “a user linked to node X must automatically read everything in X’s sub-tree” (a common requirement). If that rule is different for you—e.g. you need upward access or per-node overrides—let me know and I’ll adapt the plan.

1 · Why ltree is a good fit

Requirement	ltree capability
Million-plus nodes, depth ≤ ~20	Material-path strings are tiny; a single GIN index keeps look-ups sub-millisecond even at tens of millions of rows.
Ancestor / descendant checks	Operators @> (“contains”) and <@ (“is contained by”) are purpose-built for “does path A include path B?” questions.
Flexible hierarchy types	The same column stores countries, companies … elements; no extra join per level.
Easy to move sub-trees	A single `UPDATE … SET path = ‘new’
Works with Ecto	Path values are plain strings, so fragments or EctoLtree libraries slot right in.

Alternatives (nested-set, closure-table, recursive CTEs) either index poorly at this scale or complicate writes. Closure-tables are viable if you need fine-grained per-edge metadata, but otherwise ltree wins on simplicity + speed.

2 · Schema blueprint

2.1 Core hierarchy table

nodes
------
id           bigserial  PK
path         ltree      NOT NULL UNIQUE      -- materialised path
parent_id    bigint REFERENCES nodes(id)     -- optional, convenience only
kind         smallint   CHECK (kind IN (0-4))-- enum: 0=country … 4=element
name         text
extra_json   jsonb
created_at   timestamptz default now()

Indexing

CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS ltree;
CREATE INDEX nodes_path_gin   ON nodes USING GIN (path);

-- If you frequently need "(depth = n)" filters
CREATE INDEX nodes_depth_btree ON nodes ((nlevel(path)));

2.2 User access table

user_access
------------
user_id      bigint  FK users(id)
access_path  ltree   NOT NULL           -- root they control
grant_type   smallint default 0         -- 0=read, 1=manage, etc.
PRIMARY KEY (user_id, access_path)

Index

CREATE INDEX user_access_path_gin
  ON user_access USING GIN (access_path);

Store one row per root node a user may reach; inheritance downwards is implicit.

⸻

3 · DB-level access predicate

A compact, inlineable SQL function keeps the API call trivial and lets you add an RLS policy later if you wish.

CREATE FUNCTION can_user_see(user_id bigint, target_id bigint)
RETURNS boolean LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
DECLARE
  target_path ltree;
BEGIN
  SELECT path INTO target_path FROM nodes WHERE id = target_id;
  IF NOT FOUND THEN
    RETURN false;             -- or raise error
  END IF;

  RETURN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
      FROM user_access ua
     WHERE ua.user_id = can_user_see.user_id
       AND ua.access_path @> target_path   -- ua is ancestor OR same node
  );
END;
$$ IMMUTABLE PARALLEL SAFE;

• Performance: Both sides of @> are GIN-indexed; with 1 M nodes + 100 K user grants the call is usually 0.2–0.5 ms.

4 · Phoenix / Ecto integration
	1.	Migrations—enable ltree extension, create tables & indexes as above.
	2.	Ecto types—either:
	•	use plain :string and convert paths with path_string = Enum.join(tokens, "."), or
	•	pull ecto_lt or ecto_materialized_path for a typed wrapper (nice but optional).
	3.	Context module (Hierarchy)
	•	insert_node/3 — wrap the WITH parent AS (SELECT path …)-style insert so the material path is built server-side.
	•	update_subtree/2 — for moves; run the single UPDATE inside a transaction.
	•	user_can?/2 — Repo.one(from n in fragment("select can_user_see(?,?)", user_id, node_id)).

5 · Implementation Notes (XIAM)

In our implementation for XIAM, we made the following key design decisions:

5.1 User-defined Node Types

Rather than using a fixed enum or integer for node types, we opted for a string-based approach that allows users to define their own node types dynamically. This provides maximum flexibility while maintaining the efficiency of the ltree hierarchical structure.

```elixir
# Before (fixed enum approach)
field :node_type, :integer  # 0=country, 1=company, 2=installation, etc.

# After (flexible string approach)
field :node_type, :string   # "country", "company", "installation", or any custom type
```

To support this flexibility while maintaining a good user experience, the UI provides common type suggestions via a datalist but allows users to enter any custom type they need.

5.2 Access Control Management

We implemented a comprehensive interface for managing hierarchical access:

- Visual representation of the hierarchy with expandable/collapsible nodes
- Ability to add, edit, move, and delete nodes in the hierarchy
- Granting and revoking access to users with specific roles
- Efficient access checking using PostgreSQL's ltree operators

5.3 Performance Considerations

To achieve the required performance for 1M+ nodes, we:

- Use GIN indexes on ltree paths for fast hierarchical queries
- Execute critical access checks directly in SQL using a custom PostgreSQL function
- Implement efficient path updates when moving subtrees
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities

5.4 Future Enhancements

- Implement caching of frequent access checks for further performance improvement
- Add batch operations for managing multiple nodes simultaneously
- Develop more advanced visualization tools for large hierarchies
- Create dedicated API endpoints for programmatic access management
	4.	Controller / Router
	•	GET /api/v1/access/:id returns {"allowed": true|false}.
	•	Auth plug fetches the actor’s user_id (Guardian/PhxAuth).
	•	The action just delegates to Hierarchy.user_can?/2.

No business logic leaks into the controller; everything lives in the DB function and context, keeping latency low and the endpoint boring.

5 · Writing & maintaining the hierarchy

Operation	Recommended pattern
Insert	`INSERT … path = parent.path
Bulk import	COPY into a staging table, then a single INSERT … SELECT building path on the fly.
Move subtree	Same-tx update: `UPDATE nodes SET path = new_parent.path
Delete subtree	DELETE FROM nodes WHERE path <@ victim_path. (Foreign-key ON DELETE CASCADE handles children.)
Grant access	Insert into user_access; one row per root grant.
Revoke	Delete row; no other clean-up required.

Tip Wrap subtree moves & deletes in database functions so apps, CLI scripts, and migrations all call the same logic.

⸻

6 · Scaling & performance guards
	1.	Connection pool – keep Repo pool at least √(CPU × latency × qps) to avoid waterfalls during burst checks.
	2.	Partition if needed – if you reach > 50 M nodes, consider declarative partitioning by country_id (still compatible with GIN).
	3.	Cache hot checks – for ultra-low latency, memoise {user_id, target_path} in ETS/Cachex for a few seconds; invalidate on relevant GRANT/MOVE/DELETE events via NOTIFY.
	4.	Monitor – track heap_blks_hit/heap_blks_read for nodes and user_access, plus calls/total_time for can_user_see.

⸻

7 · Security hardening
	•	Add Row-Level Security on nodes with a policy using can_user_see(current_setting('app.user_id')::bigint, id).
	•	Reject ambiguous paths by enforcing name ~ '^[a-z0-9_]+$' and disallowing consecutive dots.
	•	Prefer database-generated UUID or BIGINT ids; avoid leaking path strings to the client if they reveal corporate structure.

⸻

8 · Testing checklist
	1.	Factories that spawn a random tree (depth 5–10, width 3–5).
	2.	Property test: for every (user, node) pair, can_user_see/2 matches a pure-Elixir DFS oracle.
	3.	Regression suite around moves (ancestor → descendant, cross-country, root promotions).
	4.	Load test: 10 k concurrent user_can?/2 over 1 M nodes; 95-percentile ≤ 1 ms is a healthy target.

⸻

9 · When not to use ltree

Switch to a closure table if you need:
	•	per-edge metadata (time-bounded grants, weights, etc.), or
	•	arbitrary graph queries (siblings by property, multiple parents).

Otherwise keep the single-column path—it is faster, simpler, and plays nicely with Postgres HA setups.

⸻

Next-step summary
	1.	Enable the extension & create the two tables + GIN indexes.
	2.	Ship can_user_see/2 and wrap it in an Ecto helper.
	3.	Expose /access/:id; call the helper.
	4.	Backfill user grants and populate the hierarchy.
	5.	Run the load test to baseline latency.
	6.	Add RLS if the API will later expose full tree endpoints.

That’s the full blueprint. Let me know if any edge cases (e.g. “user can see upwards”, multi-tenant DBs, or per-level override rules) need special handling, and I’ll extend the plan accordingly.
